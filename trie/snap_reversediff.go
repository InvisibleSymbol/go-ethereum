// Reverse diff records the state changes involved in executing a corresponding block.
// The state can be reverted to the previous status by applying reverse diff. Reverse
// diff is the guarantee that Geth can perform state rollback, for purposes of deep
// reorg, historical state tracing and so on.
//
// Each state transition will generate a corresponding reverse diff (Note that not every
// block has a reverse diff, for example, in the Clique network, if two adjacent blocks
// have no state change, then the second block has no reverse diff). Each reverse diff
// will have an id as its unique identifier. The id is a monotonically increasing number
// starting from 1(0 for empty state).
//
// The reverse diff will be written to disk (ancient store) when the corresponding diff
// layer is merged into the disk layer. At the same time, Geth can prune the oldest reverse
// diffs according to config.

//
// How does state rollback work? For example, if Geth wants to roll back its state to the state
// of block n, it first needs to check whether the reverse diff x corresponding to the state of
// block n exists. If so, all reverse diffs from the latest reverse diff to the reverse diff x
// will be applied in turn (x is included).
